        <p>When a life spent watching TV affects ones reality, how do you decipher the truth?</p>
        <p>Decades of newsworthy events flash by on TV creating the life story of Timothy King Jnr. From his mother's basement turned TV studio, he broadcasts an entire TV channel, using Foley sound effects, produced in real time by his sidekick.</p>
        <p>When disaster in his life strikes, King Jnr. escapes into a warped world of confusion. Battling with a sense of self and alter egos, reality merges with fiction, immersing the studio audience in the ultimate 3D experience.</p>
        <p>Using TV as a metaphor, KING TV questions how and why we trust and believe what’s beamed into our lounge rooms daily. Manipulating us through fear mongering and praying on our naive nature, how can we escape the strangle hold upon us?</p>
